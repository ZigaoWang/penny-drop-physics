# Physics Drop Simulator

A realistic physics simulator that demonstrates the effects of dropping objects from various heights in different environments.

## Features

- **Single & Dual Drop Modes**: Compare how different objects fall
- **Multiple Objects**: Feathers, pennies, baseballs, bowling balls, and more
- **Different Environments**: Earth, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, or custom settings
- **Real Physics**: Accurate calculations including air resistance and terminal velocity
- **Interactive Charts**: Real-time velocity, distance, height, and acceleration graphs
- **Impact Analysis**: Calculates kinetic energy and potential injury outcomes

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Choose your simulation mode (Single or Dual Drop)
3. Select objects and drop height
4. Pick an environment (Earth, Moon, Mars, etc.)
5. Click "Start Simulation" to watch the physics in action

## Physics Calculations

The simulator uses realistic formulas for:
- Free fall: `v = √(2gh)`
- Terminal velocity effects
- Kinetic energy: `KE = ½mv²`
- Air resistance based on object properties

## Educational Purpose

This tool helps visualize physics concepts like:
- Gravity's effect on different objects
- Air resistance vs vacuum conditions
- Terminal velocity
- Energy transfer on impact

**⚠️ For educational use only - do not drop objects from heights in real life**
